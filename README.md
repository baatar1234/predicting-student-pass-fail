# Predicting Student Pass Fail using Classification Models
Note: This project was created in Jupyter Notebook for Data Visualization purposes
## Goal of the Project
To build classification models (logisitic regression & decision tree) that help predict if a student will pass or fail depending on multiple features/attributes that apply to each student. Our dataset is comprised of 649 students (rows) and 33 categories (columns) for each student. We will be splitting the dataset into a testing and a training dataset to avoid any influence or bias from the training dataset onto the testing dataset when the models are being trained. 

## Steps Taken
1. Loading the data
2. Describing the data
3. Exploring the data
4. Building the models
5. Evaluating the performance of the models
6. Describing and interpreting the models

## Python Packages Used
- scikit-learn 
- pandas
- NumPy
- graphviz
- matplotlib
- itertools
- os

## Source of Dataset
The Student Performance Dataset was sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).
The dataset can be found in the current repository under /student/student-por.csv and has been split into:
- student-por-test.csv
- student-por-train.csv
